                <p>
                    Blending the timeless elegance of jazz with the versatility
                    of multiple genres, Five Note Theory is a dynamic vocal ensemble
                    that seamlessly weaves together intricate harmonies and
                    expressive storytelling. With roots in jazz but a repertoire 
                    that spans classical, choral, pop, soul, hip-hop, and beyond, 
                    this five-member group brings a fresh and sophisticated sound 
                    to every performance.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    The ensemble came together through a shared passion for vocal 
                    artistry, with its members drawing from diverse musical backgrounds. 
                    Cindy, a renowned music educator and choral director, is shaping 
                    the next generation of singers as an educator at Miami 
                    Arts Studio, and Jormilit, a former student of the same 
                    institution, is a vocal jazz student at Western Michigan University. 
                    Asriel, Leonard, and Stephen expounded their musical foundation at 
                    Oakwood University, where they immersed themselves in a 
                    tradition of vocal excellence. Though their paths varied, 
                    all five members share the unique bond of having sung with 
                    the Jason Max Ferdinand Singers, an experience that refined 
                    their precision, blend, and deep musicality.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    With a sound shaped by legendary groups like 
                    Take 6, The Manhattan Transfer, The Hi-Lo’s, The Four Freshmen, 
                    and New York Voices, their repertoire reflects a love for 
                    rich harmonies and expressive storytelling. From classic 
                    jazz standards and bossa nova grooves to reimagined rock 
                    and pop oldies, their setlist is as diverse as their influences. 
                    They also bring a soulful depth to sacred choral works, 
                    crafting powerful interpretations of sacred texts that 
                    resonate with both spiritual and secular audiences alike.
                </p><br>

                    Whether delivering a silky-smooth jazz ballad, a rhythmically 
                    charged pop arrangement, or an ethereal choral setting, 
                    Five Note Theory is committed to pushing vocal boundaries 
                    while staying true to the art of close harmony singing. 
                    With a sound that is both nostalgic and forward-thinking, 
                    they invite listeners on a journey through the rich landscape 
                    of vocal music—one note at a time.
